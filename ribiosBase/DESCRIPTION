Description: RiBIOS (R interface to BIOS) is a collection of R packages
    dedicated to bioinformatics, computational biology, and data analysis tasks. It
    is built on the thoroughly tested C library BIOS/Bioinfolib that is developed
    by the Roche Bioinformatics Group. This package provides source code of the
    Bioinfolib and is the foundation of other ribios packages that need to call C-
    level functions.
